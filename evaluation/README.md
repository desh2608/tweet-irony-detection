# SemEval-2018 Task 3 - evaluation script #

evaluate.py
This is the official scoring script for SemEval-2018 Task 3: Irony detection in English tweets. The scoring script will be used to evaluate both subtask A and B.

The script looks at the input data to define the subtask at hand. It is therefore important that participants give correct names to their submission files.
* Task A: predictionsTaskA.txt
* Task B: predictionsTaskB.txt

The script outputs a file scores.txt with the accuracy, precision, recall and <b>F<sub>1</sub>-score</b> corresponding to the submission.

Questions or remarks on the scoring programme can be addressed in the Google discussion forum of this task: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/semeval2018-task3.
